import { Link } from 'gatsby'

<p>
  Almost every project I've completed, I had to get some form of unique values
  from an array to display links, titles, or categories. The very first time I
  encountered this problem was when I was working on{' '}
  <a href="https://heatherdick.ca">Heather</a>'s website and I literally spent
  three days trying to figure out this problem despite the solution provided on{' '}
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960473/get-all-unique-values-in-a-javascript-array-remove-duplicates">
    Stack Overflow
  </a>
  .
</p>

<p>
  Data was coming in from Strapi and was querying through GraphQL. It looked
  like this:
</p>

```javascript

resume=[
  {category: 'theatre', name: 'False Claims', 'role':'Linda', ...},
  {category: 'theatre', name: 'Electra', 'role':'Clytemnestra', ...},
  {category: 'film', name: 'fireworks', 'role':'Theresa', ...},
  {category: 'film', name: 'resident evil:Apocalpse', 'role':'Scientist', ...},
  ...
]
```

<p>
  If I iterate through this array and display some JSX, I would have categories
  displayed on every line of each role and that was not what I wanted. Here's
  the solution I came up with.
</p>

```javascript
  // GET UNIQUE CATEGORIES
  const getCategories = items => {
    // Iterate through an array and return a new array with only the categories.
    let tempItems = items.map(item=> item.category);
    // new Set stores only the unique values
    let tempCategories = new Set(tempItems);
    let categories = Array.from(tempCategories);
    return categories = [...categories];
  }

  // Store unique values in a state
  const [categories, setCategories] = useState(getCategories(resume));

  // Sort resume item according to created time & display each resume item
  const renderList = categoryResume => resume
    .sort((a,b) => b.created_at > a.created_at ? 1 : -1)
    .map(item => {
      if(item.category === categoryResume) {
        return <ResumeItem key={item.id} item={item}/>
      }
      return null;
    });

  ...
  // Component return
  return (
    ...
    {categories.map((category,index)=>(
      <div key={index}>
        <h1>{category}</h1>
        {renderList(category)}
      </div>
    ))}
  )

```

<p>This solution is not perfect but it made the most sense to me at the time. I'm not sure why I used state to store categories since getCategories() returns an array of unique categories at the end. Anyways, I thought I would keep this in the notes since I've used it a couple more times in the most recent projects.</p>
