          I am amazed by how fast frontend technologies have evolved in the past
          year. I have witnessed an outpouring of new updates, tutorials, and
          articles on the internet. In keeping up with the latest industry
          standards, I have found that being a frontend developer is a
          never-ending learning journey. It feels incredibly good to learn
          something new each day.

          I am passionate about bridging the gap between the design &
          engineering when creating world-class products that have lasting
          impact. I also enjoy being surrounded by people who are just as eager
          to learn from me, as I am from them.
